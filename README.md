# Introduction
This is a simple color check project. You just have to enter a color `hex`, `name` or `rgb` example:

```css
#00ff00
green
0002555000
```

To declare a rgb value, you have to put all the 3 digits segments.
```css
rgb(255, 0, 123)
```
You'll have to enter
```js
255000123
```

# Installation
First you'll need to copy this repo.

Then run: _(assuming you're in the project folder)_
```bash
npm run dev
```
